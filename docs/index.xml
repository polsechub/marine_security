<p>At a January maritime security forum, Rear Admiral Jo-Ann Burdian made headlines for asserting that <a href="https://www.sportfishingmag.com/news/illegal-fishing-worse-than-piracy/">illegal fishing had surpassed piracy</a> as a top concern of the U.S. Coast Guard. As the head of strategic response doctrine and policy guidance for the Coast Guard, Burdian noted that illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing threatens the food security of many coastal nations and has already led to <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/china-seeks-maritime-dominance-gunboat-filled-fishing-fleets-1673672">clashes at sea</a> between international fishing fleets. While the total volume of IUU fishing has declined somewhat in recent years as international bodies have focused greater attention on the issue (see Figure&nbsp;2 below), it continues to be a significant problem, with the <a href="http://www.seaaroundus.org">Sea Around Us</a> project estimating more than 24 million tons of global IUU fish catch in 2019, the most recent year for which such estimates are available. Aggregate totals such as these also obscure the fact that while some regions have dramatically reduced IUU fishing, in other countries like Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone it has more than doubled over the past decade. The map above displays IUU catch as a percentage of total fish catch by exclusive economic zone (EEZ) for the year 2019.</p>
<p>The desire to find effective solutions to the problem of IUU fishing has naturally prompted growing interest in understanding the underlying factors that drive the activity. As a distinctly economic form of crime, existing research has understandably focused on the economic factors and regulatory regimes that shape the profitability and risks associated with IUU fishing. To date, however, research efforts have largely overlooked corruption as a possible factor. As a result, the potential role of corruption in illegal fishing remains an open question, which we will begin to explore here.</p>

<p><strong>Key Drivers of IUU Fishing</strong></p>
<p>Existing research on the drivers of IUU fishing largely follows the conceptual framework of a foundational <a href="https://www.oecd.org/greengrowth/fisheries/whyfishpiracypersiststheeconomicsofillegalunreportedandunregulatedfishing.htm">2005 OECD study</a> in drawing potential causal factors from two broad categories: economic and institutional (see for example, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2014.09.005">Petrossian</a>, <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/1081/1/012013">Leonardo and Deeb</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2005.09.008">Le Gallic and Cox</a>). Economic factors influence the expected benefits of engaging in IUU fishing and include elements such as excess fishing sector capacity, fishing subsidies, fish prices, the presence of lucrative fish species, and general economic conditions and prospects for legitimate alternative opportunities. Institutional factors, on the other hand, largely shape the perceived risks and costs that offset the economic gains that can be attained through IUU fishing. Key institutional factors include gaps in international legal frameworks, the nature and severity of penalties, and the capacity and effectiveness of states’ Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance (MCS) programs. Together, these various factors determine the overall profitability of IUU fishing (the financial gain minus costs and risks) and the prevalence of the activity can be thought of as directly related to its attractiveness in comparison to alternative economic opportunities.</p>
<p>For obvious reasons, research on institutional factors has placed a pronounced emphasis on MCS as a direct determinant of the likelihood of detection and punishment of illegal fishers. The approach to such research, however, has almost exclusively focused on measures of capacity, such as numbers of patrol boats or military expenditures. While these resources are an important component in MCS, they alone do not adequately speak to the effectiveness of MCS efforts. The ultimate impact of MCS also depends on the extent to which resources are being actively devoted to combatting IUU in comparison to other security priorities, as well as the actual rigor of enforcement of fishing rules when violations are observed. It is with respect to this enforcement aspect that corruption becomes particularly relevant.</p>
<p>Corruption directly undermines the deterrence effects of enforcement by substantially reducing the risk and cost of punishment. <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1830482">Criminological deterrence theory</a> holds that deterrence effects are directly linked to the certainty and severity of punishment. When a climate of corruption prevails, however, would-be lawbreakers recognize that even if caught, they can generally avoid punishment for the comparatively low cost of a bribe. This reduction in the risk of punishment effectively increases the perceived net profitability of criminal activity. As a result, we can expect to see higher rates of IUU fishing for countries in which corruption is more prevalent.</p>
<p><strong>The Role of Corruption</strong></p>
<p>To examine the real world effects of corruption on IUU fishing, we have constructed a Generalized Estimating Equation model for data from 116 coastal countries for the years 1995 to 2016, resulting in 2371 individual state-year observations. IUU catch data is sourced from the <a href="http://www.seaaroundus.org">Sea Around Us</a> project and is presented as a percentage of the country’s total fish catch to adjust for vast differences in fishery size and production and provide a basis for meaningful comparisons between countries. As a point of reference, the IUU percentage data has an average value of 37.03% across all state-years, with half of all values falling between 19.44% and 50.94%. Corruption is measured using the Political Corruption Index in the <a href="https://www.v-dem.net">Varieties of Democracy</a> dataset, which scores countries from 0 to 1 with higher scores indicating higher levels of corruption. The model also includes controls for state weakness and regime type (using the State Fragility Index and Polity5 data respectively from the <a href="https://www.systemicpeace.org/index.html">Center for Systemic Peace</a>), state security capacity (using military expenditures data from the <a href="https://correlatesofwar.org">Correlates of War Project</a>), coastline length as a proxy for scale of the sea zone to be monitored (taken from the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/">CIA World Fact Book</a>), and <a href="https://data.worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> GDP per capita (purchasing power parity) and population data.</p>

</div>
<p>The model results showed corruption to be statistically significant at the 99% confidence level, providing solid support for our hypothesis that corruption influences the rate of IUU fishing. Figure&nbsp;3 above displays the specific effects of corruption on the IUU fishing rate with all other variables held constant at their average values. It shows that over the range of corruption scores, the rate of illegal fishing steadily increases from a low of 32.97% to 41.70%, equivalent to a change of roughly 1% for every change of 0.1 in the corruption index.</p>
<p>These effects are even more pronounced when we replace the Political Corruption Index score in the model with the more narrowly focused component indicator for bribery in the public sector (one of several components aggregated in the calculation of the composite index score). The statistical significance for the bribery indicator increases to the 99.9% confidence level and the effects on the IUU rate expand to a range of 30.30% to 42.69% (see Figure&nbsp;4 below). This further corroborates our theory of bribery of enforcement officials as the key mechanism linking corruption with IUU fishing.</p>

</figure>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The model also showed that state weakness (as measured by the State Fragility Index) had a substantial impact on IUU fishing, but that other direct measures of security capabilities such as military expenditures and the commonly used <a href="https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/national-material-capabilities/">Composite Index of National Capabilities</a> did <em>not</em> meaningfully influence IUU outcomes. Again, this casts doubt on the capabilities-centric approach to MCS evaluation that prevails in current IUU research. Also interesting, however, is the interplay between state weakness and corruption. Figure&nbsp;5 below plots the marginal effects of corruption relative to values in the State Fragility Index and demonstrates that the impact of corruption becomes larger as state weakness increases. This behavior was identical for model using the bribery indicator and is not being separately displayed.</p>

<p><strong>Implications for Policy</strong></p>
<p>Without a doubt, improvements in Monitoring, Control, and Surveillance mechanisms are crucial to combatting IUU fishing and effective fisheries management. However, these results suggest that strategies that solely focus on capabilities development are likely to have a limited effect. If left unaddressed, pervasive corruption can be expected to exert a powerful mitigating impact on any such efforts. This highlights the simple, but often neglected, truth that detection and enforcement are not one and the same. Effective MCS requires both the ability to identify and interdict illegal fishers and the professionalism to properly and consistently enforce the laws. Thus, capability-building must emphasize performance standards and anti-corruption measures wherever necessary.</p>

  <title>Enabling Pirates: Why Corruption Matters</title>
  <dc:creator>Jeremy Dean</dc:creator>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>In today’s highly globalized economy, maritime shipping increasingly acts as the backbone of global supply chains and the lynchpin that sustains economic activity throughout the world. The COVID-19 pandemic and its associated public health restrictions recently provided a highly visible demonstration of the far-reaching consequences that any disruption to this tightly interwoven system can have. This highlights the importance of understanding and effectively controlling threats to shipping such as piracy.</p>
<p>In this regard, most recognize that corruption is a critical element in the piracy story. Indeed, the world’s two foremost piracy hotspots, Indonesia and Nigeria, are both well known for high levels of corruption (currently ranking 110th and 150th in the world respectively according to the <a href="https://www.transparency.org/en/cpi/2022">2022 assessment by Transparency International</a>). At present, however, the empirical research to fully develop our understanding of the connections between corruption and piracy is virtually nonexistent, a deficiency we aim to rectify here.</p>
<p><strong>Corruption and the Economic Opportunities for Piracy</strong></p>
<p>Most researchers agree that piracy can be best understood through an economic opportunities framework. The central argument in this approach (originated by <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1830482">Becker</a> in 1968) is that individuals, in seeking to maximize their economic gains, will choose to engage in criminal activities when the expected earnings (adjusted for the risk and severity of possible punishment) outweigh their legitimate economic opportunities. By extension, total rates of piracy in a region reflect the aggregation of these individual decisions and are broadly driven by the local conditions that shape the opportunity structure. Thus, existing piracy research has largely emphasized economic conditions, particularly within the fishing industry, in the understanding that inadequate economic opportunities will prompt larger numbers to turn to the illicit gains of piracy as an alternative source of income to meet their financial needs.</p>
<p>Within this framework, there are two key mechanisms through which corruption can be expected to influence the opportunity structure. The first is by limiting legitimate economic opportunities. Numerous studies have explored the relationship between corruption and economic growth. Aside from a handful of exceptions in particular circumstances, these <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2016.03.011">studies broadly find</a> that corruption significantly reduces economic growth and development. This suggests that the availability of legitimate forms of employment and the expected economic gains that they offer will be reduced for countries in which corruption is prevalent. This can be expected to increase the likelihood that individuals will perceive the potential proceeds of piracy as preferable in comparison.</p>
<p>Secondly, and more importantly, corruption directly impacts the net gains associated with piracy by altering the associated costs. Corruption affords the prospective pirate the opportunity to substantially reduce (if not eliminate entirely) the risk of detection and punishment in exchange for a relatively small financial payment in the form of a bribe. This can be assumed to reduce the total costs of a pirate attack (as the pirate retains the option of “taking his chances” if the expected costs of punishment are less than the cost of bribery), thereby increasing the retained net gains. Furthermore, conditions of widespread corruption can produce a <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/10911421221127098">crime-corruption nexus</a> that sustains organized crime and undermines efforts to increase enforcement.</p>
<p>In sum, both mechanisms indicate that higher levels of corruption should be expected to lead to an increased threat of piracy. The question, however, is whether real world data will confirm that measures of corruption can reliably predict the occurrence of piracy, and does so in a way that is not simply coincidental.</p>
<p><strong>Actual Effects of Corruption on Piracy</strong></p>
<p>To test this predicted relationship, we will compare total piracy event counts from the <a href="https://brandonprins.weebly.com/mpeld.html">Maritime Piracy Event and Location Data Project</a> (MPELD) compiled by Brandon Prins with corruption measurements from the World Bank’s <a href="https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/search/dataset/0038026/Worldwide-Governance-Indicators">Worldwide Governance Indicators</a> data by country for the years 1996 - 2016. More specifically, we are using the Control of Corruption Estimates indicator, which assigns a score for each country ranging from approximately -2 (for highest corruption) to 2.5 (for lowest corruption). Figure&nbsp;1 below shows a simple scatterplot of the data, broadly indicating that most piracy does indeed occur in countries with heightened levels of corruption.</p>
<div id="fig-plot" class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center anchored">
<figure class="figure">

<p><img src="https://polsechub.github.io/marine_security/posts/Corruption/figures/blog_plot2.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>To assess the actual significance of this relationship, we will construct a predictive model using a Generalized Estimating Equation, which accounts for correlations in the data within countries across the time series. To ensure the validity of the results, the model will control for a number of potentially relevant factors identified in previous research, including a measure of state weakness (the State Fragility Index from the <a href="https://www.systemicpeace.org/index.html">Center for Systemic Peace</a>), regime type (Polity5 data, also from the Center for Systemic Peace), military expenditures as a measure of security capabilities (from the <a href="https://correlatesofwar.org">Correlates of War Project</a>), GDP per capita (purchasing power parity), coastline length, and population. Additionally, to ease the interpretation of the results, the Corruption Estimates indicator is adjusted from its initial high to low corruption format to a more intuitive low to high scale. Altogether, the model examines a total of 1,848 state-year observations from 110 countries. The results are presented in the two tables below.</p>

<p>As can be seen in Table&nbsp;2, the coefficient for corruption is positive and significant (at the 95% confidence level), indicating that more corruption does indeed result in more piracy. More specifically, it suggests that all else being equal, a country with a level of corruption equivalent to the global average will experience more than three times as much piracy as it would if it had a very low corruption score of 0.5. Furthermore, not only does piracy increase with corruption, the <em>rate</em> of increase also increases. The marginal effects graph in Figure&nbsp;2 (a) displays the rate of change in the predicted attack count relative to corruption (with all other variables held constant at their respective averages), and indicates that the rate of piracy can be expected to double for every increase of 1.22 in the corruption score. More importantly, perhaps, a relatively modest 0.5 improvement in the corruption score can be expected to reduce the incidence of piracy by 25%.</p>

</figure>
</div>
<p>Also noteworthy is the manner in which corruption interacts with state weakness. Previous research has repeatedly found state weakness to be a significant factor in the incidence of piracy, with weaker states experiencing more attacks, and these findings offer further corroboration. Figure&nbsp;2 (b) above (on the right) plots the marginal effects of corruption on piracy at various levels of state weakness. It demonstrates that the effects of corruption become stronger as state weakness increases (up until a fragility score of twenty, the threshold commonly regarded as the point at which state weakness becomes outright state failure). Thus, not only can we intuitively expect weak states to exhibit more corruption, the impact of that corruption on piracy will be more severe.</p>
<p>Interestingly, contrary to previous research, the model also finds that state capabilities (as measured by military expenditures) do <em>not</em> meaningfully impact piracy outcomes. This result holds, even when replacing military expenditures with the broader <a href="https://correlatesofwar.org/data-sets/national-material-capabilities/">Composite Index of National Capabilities</a>. This implies that capabilities may lose significance once corruption is introduced into the statistical modeling. It also suggests that the instinctive response to increase security capabilities may have little impact on piracy.</p>
<p><strong>Implications for Policy</strong></p>
<p>These findings have important implications for policymakers seeking to address the threat of piracy. They indicate that policy approaches that narrowly focus on increasing security capacity and enforcement are unlikely to be successful as long as corruption remains a significant problem. This is particularly relevant for third party nations, such as the United States, which frequently turn to foreign aid and security assistance as options of first resort in addressing transnational issues of concern. Not only does corruption risk diverting such funds from their intended use, it ultimately does not matter how capable the relevant authorities are so long as they are willing to turn a blind eye for a cut of the profits. This is not to say that security capabilities are entirely irrelevant or should be ignored, simply that they cannot be the sole focus of piracy mitigation efforts. A truly effective strategy must emphasize substantive efforts to reduce corruption and improve governance alongside capacity-building endeavors.</p>

  <title>COVID-19 and Maritime Piracy</title>

<p>It is now three years since COVID-19 began its surge across the globe. Many nations are still grappling with the economic, social, and political fallout from the pandemic and the emergency public health measures implemented in response. A <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002712453709">recently published study</a> by Aaron Gold, Anup Phayal, and Brandon Prins indicates that these effects also extend to an increased risk of maritime piracy. This study examines piracy data for Nigeria and Indonesia, two of the world’s most prominent piracy enclaves, using an interrupted time series analysis to compare trends in activity before and after the most stringent pandemic restrictions were put in place. Although the evidence is less definitive in the Indonesia case, the results for both countries show a reversal from declining trends in pre-restriction monthly piracy incidents to increasing trends afterward.</p>
<p>This study fits into a growing body of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0022002712453709">research</a> demonstrating empirical support for an economic explanation of piracy. It suggests that individuals will turn to illicit activities as an alternative source of income in regions where legitimate economic opportunities are inadequate to sustain livelihoods and meet financial needs. For coastal and fishing communities, such individuals are more likely to be drawn to perpetrating piracy and armed robberies on ships since they already possess the local knowledge and navigational skills that make them likely to succeed. &nbsp;This trend is particularly common among weak coastal states, which frequently fail to sufficiently provide for the economic needs of broad swaths of the population (particularly the poor and politically unconnected) and where the capacity to police the waters is limited.</p>
<p><img src="https://polsechub.github.io/marine_security/posts/COVID-19 and maritime piracy/figures/Picture1.png" class="img-fluid" style="height: 85%;" data-fig-align="center"> The research by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/22338659221151130">Gold, Phayal, and Prins</a> emphasizes that the economic hardships from COVID-19 restrictions have prompted an increase in piracy incidents, similar to the surges seen in the aftermath of economic shocks in the past. Understanding such connections between economic grievances and piracy is crucial to formulating effective counter-piracy strategies. It suggests that policies should not solely rely on increased maritime patrolling and enforcement mechanisms, but must also address the underlying causes through improved governance and long-term investments in the economic vitality of coastal communities and fisheries. Additionally, it adds to policymakers’ understanding of the ancillary costs of pandemic mitigation measures to help inform responses to future public health crises. &nbsp;</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>In January 2021, the <a href="https://shippingwatch.com/carriers/Container/article12711387.ece"><em>MV Mozart</em></a>, a large Liberian flagged container ship on its way to Cape Town, South Africa from Lagos, Nigeria, was seized by Nigerian-based pirates close to Sao Tome's maritime border. Fifteen abducted officers and crew members were released later in February after the shipping company paid a ransom, but one sailor died in the assault.</p>
<p>The attack was one of at least 38 incidents that occurred during the first quarter of 2021. Although the number of pirate incidents has decreased over the last year , the number of kidnapped sailors surged, nearly doubling from the year before, and are at the highest level in a decade according to the <a href="https://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre">International Maritime Bureau</a>.</p>
<p>Piracy might be pervasive, but it remains geographically restricted. Nearly half of these pirate attacks and attempted attacks in 2021, including the one on the <em>MV Mozart</em>,&nbsp; occurred in and around the Gulf of Guinea. <a href="https://brandonprins.weebly.com/indo-pacific-crime.html">Our research</a> shows shows that contested maritime boundaries are partly driving the location of <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/pirate-lands-9780190097394?cc=ca&amp;lang=en&amp;">sea-piracy</a>.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center" style="">

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 1</strong>: MV Mozard location when attacked, January 23, 2021</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p><strong>Maritime Crime Clusters Around Specific Locations</strong></p>
<p>Hot spots stand out when examining pirate attacks. Five countries account for over 60% of the total pirate attacks between 1995 and 2017, and nearly 75% of the more sophisticated attacks against steaming ships. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0022002712453709?casa_token=TeMGx2ppwEMAAAAA%3AzLDTyjCcX_gXc7GWCPLwUC9qeggK3m4wvoxr4PsDGasccVZ9_JWmfqqe89nvh4BPff2HFoqtFg">Economic deprivation</a> explains much of what drives piracy in Somalia, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Nigeria.</p>
<p>Yet while poverty and joblessness are widespread, where the pirate attacks occur is more <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/01/25/what-do-pirates-want-to-steal-riches-at-sea-so-they-can-pay-for-wars-on-land/">highly contained</a>. For example, thousands of vessels transit the Singapore Straits each year, making it one of the <a href="https://www.seatrade-maritime.com/asia/exclusive-malacca-straits-vlcc-traffic-doubles-decade-shipping-traffic-hits-all-time-high-2017">busiest sea-lanes</a> in the world, and consequently a frequent location for maritime crime. Pirates always look for rich "targets of opportunity," such as shipping lanes, geographic chokepoints, and ports, but this isn't enough to explain the geographic foundations of sea-piracy.</p>
<p><strong>Contested Maritime Boundaries and Pirate Attacks</strong></p>
<p>Our research suggests that pirates exploit porous maritime boundary lines—the lines that mark countries' territorial waters—and &nbsp;are particularly attracted to areas where countries have conflicted and uncertain territorial water claims.</p>
<p>The figure below shows the frequency of off-shore sea-piracy incidents in the Indo-Pacific region from 1995 to 2016. Ship attacks occur closer to maritime boundaries than one would expect by chance alone. <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300180749/pirates">Peter Lehr</a> notes similar behavior in the 19<sup>th</sup> century as pirates exploited competition among European colonial powers to evade capture.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center" style="">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://polsechub.github.io/marine_security/posts/Hot pursuit and piracy/figures/Picture2.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Disctance to nearest maritime boundary from piracy incidents</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Why would we see pirates attacking along these contested boundaries? Because pirates and other maritime criminals understand that they can exploit the fear of conflict escalation between countries to dodge state security personnel.</p>
<p>Coast guard forces and maritime police hesitate to enter the territorial waters of neighboring states since such maritime trespassing might lead to diplomatic crises or standoffs, especially between governments that already dispute local borders.This is what we see in the Gulf of Guinea and Southeast Asia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pirates are also likely to attack closer to countries with weaker law enforcement capacity. It is no accident that most incidents of piracy occur in the eastbound lane of the <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/armed-robbery-incidents-in-singapore-strait-rise-to-20-in-first-half-of-2021">Singapore Straits</a>, which sits closer to Indonesia's Riau Islands, and therefore are less likely to attract maritime patrols from Singapore, a more capable state in the region.</p>
<p><strong>Joint national action with local implementation</strong></p>
<p>Conflict over maritime boundaries also undermines countries' ability to combat maritime time.</p>
<p>Under international law (<a href="https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf">United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Article 111</a>), coastal states can extend their jurisdiction beyond their own maritime border to pursue and seize any vessel involved in illicit activities. The chase must begin in the territorial waters (or contiguous zone) where the illegal activity took place and continue into international waters.</p>
<p>But once the pirate's vessel crosses into the territorial waters of another state, the hunt must end, and the law enforcement ship turn back unless bilateral or regional agreements exist that sanction cross-border pursuit. In areas where maritime conflict prevails, such agreements are unlikely. While a country may want to secure maritime trade routes, countering maritime crime is costly and the conflict over maritime boundaries is often more salient to overall security interests.</p>
<p>For this reason, countries locked in maritime conflict will fail to pursue pirates and other maritime criminals effectively. In 1992, for example, the Royal Malaysian Police Marines chased a suspected pirate vessel out of Malaysian waters. Rather than follow the ship into Filipino maritime space, the captain of the Malaysian ship opted to turn around and return to <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10576109808436055">Malaysian territorial waters</a>. A 1994 agreement between Malaysia and the Philippines allowed for coordinated patrols in Sulu and Celebes Seas, but only along their shared maritime boundaries, and cross-border pursuits remained prohibited.</p>
<p>The two countries (along with Indonesia) revisited the issue of coordinated patrols in 2016 as Abu Sayyaf increased attacks against ships in the area. Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte <a href="https://www.news24.com/news24/world/news/philippines-allows-pursuit-of-kidnappers-into-its-waters-20161111">conceded</a> to hot pursuit given concerns about maritime piracy and the threat of terrorist violence. Remaining disagreements over territorial claims, jurisdictional control, and resource management prevent deeper cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>Cooperation is Key to Tackling Maritime Piracy</strong></p>
<p>What does our study mean for maritime security in the Indo-Pacific and US counter-piracy operations? Our research demonstrates that maritme crime can thrive where states are locked in contention and local law enforcement remains limited. Further, states in the Indo-Pacific are unlikely to be successful at reducing sea-piracy single-handedly.</p>
<p>That's why the <a href="https://media.defense.gov/2019/Jul/01/2002152311/-1/-1/1/DEPARTMENT-OF-DEFENSE-INDO-PACIFIC-STRATEGY-REPORT-2019.PDF">US Navy</a> trains annually with militaries and coastguards in the region and the <a href="https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Free-and-Open-Indo-Pacific-4Nov2019.pdf">US State Department</a> has increased infrastructure assistance to help <a href="https://www.dvidshub.net/news/400652/illegal-unreported-and-unregulated-fishing-pacific">combat IUU fishing</a>. The USAID has also increased assistance to the region, with a specific effort to strengthen political institutions (<a href="https://www.usaid.gov/indo-pacific-vision/dem">Indo-Pacific Transparency Initiative</a>).</p>
<p>Formal military agreements, training opportunities, and joint action with other states, and through <a href="https://en.vietnamplus.vn/malaysian-media-affirm-aseans-role-in-settlement-of-east-sea-issues/204480.vnp">ASEAN</a>, from information sharing to confidence-building measures to shared patrols, when done right, are effective at preventing maritime crime. The absence of such cooperation will only push illegal activities to the other side of the border.</p>

  <description><![CDATA[ 




<p>2020 was a bad year for maritime piracy. The global number of sea-piracy incidents rose by over 20% from 2019 and West Africa experienced the highest number of attacks and attempted attacks since data collection began in the early 1990s at the <a href="https://www.icc-ccs.org/piracy-reporting-centre">International Maritime Bureau’s Piracy Reporting Center</a> (see Figure 1). But the Gulf of Guinea was not the only piracy hotspot in 2020. In fact, attacks increased in Southeast Asia and the Americas, as <a href="https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/06/04/crime-in-indonesia-surges-in-late-may-police.html">land-based crime</a> appeared to spill over into the ports and anchorages of Dumai, Taboneo, Callao, and Macapa. &nbsp;Kidnappings jumped sharply in 2020 and the illegal boarding of steaming ships reached its highest level in five years. Some recent <a href="https://theconversation.com/attacks-at-sea-arent-all-linked-to-piracy-why-its-important-to-unpick-whats-what-153591">headlines</a> appear to minimize the threat of sea-piracy and fail to appreciate the harmful economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Yet, previous financial crises have been followed by significant surges in maritime crime. The novel Coronavirus will likely produce similar conditions that have fueled ship targeting in the past.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center" style="">
<figure class="figure">
<p><img src="https://polsechub.github.io/marine_security/posts/Maritime Piracy in 2020-2021/figures/figure1.png" class="img-fluid figure-img"></p>
<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 1</strong>: Piracy Counts by Region and Global, 1993-2020 (IMB Data)</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The 1997-98 Asian financial crisis sharply reduced incomes, increased regional unemployment, and drove up food prices, all of which amplified poverty levels in many Southeast Asian countries (see <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1468018109106886">here</a>). Pirate attacks in the region subsequently jumped by 80% from 1998 to 1999 and another 50% from 1999 to 2000, going from 89 incidents recorded by the IMB in 1998 to 247 incidents only two years later. Sea-piracy did not return to its pre-Asian financial crisis levels until 2006, and then the region was buffeted by a global recession that began in the United States only a year later. Incidents of sea-piracy and armed robbery on ships nearly quadrupled over the next five years in Indonesian waters and Somali pirates dramatically escalated their seizure of commercial vessels beginning in 2008 (see Figure 2).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have been similarly devastating: job losses, negative growth rates, and increased poverty. Indeed, according to the <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WEO/Issues/2020/09/30/world-economic-outlook-october-2020#Chapter%202:%20The%20Great%20Lockdown,%20Dissecting%20The%20Economic%20Effects">IMF</a>, China is the only major economy projected to have a positive growth rate in 2020. The economies of most other countries contracted, some by more than 5%. Overall, the global economy likely shrunk by 4% in 2020 and an additional 120 million people were pushed into poverty (see <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2020/10/21/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-global-extreme-poverty/">here</a>). The economic costs of the pandemic have been particularly challenging for many piracy-prone countries. The IMF expects sizable unemployment increases in Indonesia, Uruguay, Brazil, Mexico, and the Philippines. Grim, and longer lasting, economic conditions are anticipated for many countries in West Africa. It is true that the IMF expects an economic rebound in 2021 and some countries, like China, may experience a V-shaped recovery. But, pre-COVID economic malaise in many places almost certainly spells a slower recovery process for most countries.</p>
<p>Underlying economic conditions remain important for understanding why individuals engage in illicit maritime activities. Multiples studies point to the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002712453709?casa_token=7jzUkmC7z1MAAAAA:frsBAGmSiTCNBYlgMQlTa_9SKvJOWeLU1Agjco_8sxOKdnc9bdEpg6-IrHBfS87m-Qlt-lVNxw">absence of legal opportunities in the local economy</a>, particularly the local fishing industry, as a motivating factor that drives maritime crime and violence. The Corona-Virus pandemic is currently hitting the global fishing industry hard. COVID-19 mitigation efforts have led to downturns in the Fish Price Index as well as expected future declines in supply, production, consumption, and trade revenues. The FAO anticipates global fish production fell by 1.7% in 2020, which would equate to a 1.4% decline in aquaculture output, a devastating downturn not seen in 60 years (for more, see <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/cb2823en/cb2823en.pdf">here</a>). COVID-19 restrictions have especially hit workers hard in developing countries as <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-global-seafood-trade-maine-9f61277ba1ba3e01a062b341df6f90f2">demand for seafood</a> has dropped in many wealthy countries.</p>
<p>The IMB is not the only organization to note an increase in maritime crime in 2020. Other piracy reporting centers also reported sizable increases, as well (see Figure 2). The <a href="https://gisis.imo.org/Public/Default.aspx/">International Maritime Organization</a>, an arm of the United Nations, and <a href="https://www.recaap.org/">ReCAAP</a>, the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combatting Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia, both registered sharp jumps in attacks in 2020. And, the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence, through its Anti-ship Activity Messaging System, recorded 264 incidents in 2020, an increase of over 70% from 2019. All of these organizations also show striking surges in piracy incidents following the two most recent financial crises.</p>
<div class="quarto-figure quarto-figure-center" style="">
<figure class="figure">

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 2</strong>: Piracy and Armed Robbery on Ships, Various Reporting Organizations</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>To be sure, global piracy counts currently remain far lower than previous surges and there are notable successes in counter-piracy operations. In 2020, for example, no incidents were reported by the IMB in the greater Gulf of Aden and reports from Southeast Asia mostly noted simple armed robberies on ships rather than more serious hijackings&nbsp; or crew abductions (see <a href="https://www.recaap.org/resources/ck/files/reports/annual/ReCAAP%20ISC%20Annual%20Report%202020.pdf">ReCAAP annual report</a>). Only one category 1 incident (the most serious type of attack) was reported by ReCAAP in 2020, a significant drop from only a few years ago. Further, <a href="https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2020/07/15/better-sea-security-with-upgraded-radar/">port security in Malaysia</a> appears to have improved and security enhancements at the Chittagong Port in Bangladesh continue to keep robberies on anchored ships well below their numbers from only a few years ago (additional CCTV cameras were installed to monitor port activity and restrictions on movement were added – see <a href="https://tbsnews.net/bangladesh/infrastructure/208-more-cc-tv-cameras-be-put-chittagong-port-42767">here</a>).</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, the Singapore Straits remains an area of particular concern (mostly the eastern sector). Over 100,000 vessels transit the narrow, 105 km passage every year, carrying critical supplies, such as oil, iron ore, food, and palm oil. In 2020, the IMB recorded 23 attacks in the Straits (see Figure 4), nearly doubling the number of incidents from 2019 and reaching the highest level of sea-piracy activity recorded by the IMB in the Singapore Straits since data collection began. ReCAAP shows higher pirate activity in the Straits during 2014 and 2015, but both organizations report significant increases in ship attacks over the past three years.</p>

<p></p><figcaption class="figure-caption"><strong>Figure 3</strong>: Number of Piracy Incidents in Singapore Straits, 1993-2020 (IMB data)</figcaption><p></p>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Despite increased pirate activity in the Singapore Straits, the Gulf of Guinea remains the most dangerous maritime zone in the world today. Over 40% of all pirate attacks and attempted attacks occur in the waters of West Africa, which is the highest percentage since IMB data collection began. The incidents in West Africa continue to be more violent than other regions and nearly all crew abductions recorded globally occur in the greater Gulf of Guinea. At least 130 crew members were taken hostage by West African pirates in 2020, nearly double from just two years before, and sailor kidnappings do not appear to be slowing so far in 2021. On January 23<sup>rd</sup>, 15 crew members from a Turkish-operated but Liberian flagged ship 98 nautical miles northwest of Sao Tome and Principe in the Gulf of Guinea were abducted by pirates. The <em>M/V Mozart</em> was en route from Lagos to Cape Town when it was attacked. Along with the 15 kidnapped sailors, one Azerbaijani crew member was killed in the encounter. The pirates are demanding a <a href="https://www.dailysabah.com/turkey/pirates-who-kidnapped-turkish-seamen-off-nigeria-make-1st-contact/news">ransom</a> from the shipping company for the release of the kidnapped crew. Only a few days later, another large cargo ship was <a href="https://gcaptain.com/eagle-bulk-ship-escapes-pirate-attack-in-gulf-of-guinea/">boarded</a> by pirates in the Gulf of Guinea. This time, however, they failed to break into the ship’s citadel and were forced to quit the vessel.</p>
<p>While piracy and armed robbery on ships increased in 2020, the pandemic has also affected maritime crime more generally, sometimes favorably. The first half of 2020 in the Indo-Pacific saw an increase in Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing compared to 2018, but actually a decrease from the same period in 2019. Most reports of IUU fishing from January to June 2020 occurred in the territorial waters of the Philippines, and then in Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand (<a href="https://www.ifc.org.sg/ifc2web/app_pages/User/common/SharingPublications.cshtml">see more here</a>). In the Philippines, the COVID-19 lockdown from March 17 to May 15 occurred during the country’s primary fishing season. IUU fishing appears to have <a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2020/06/lockdown-allowed-illegal-fishing-to-spike-in-philippines-satellite-data-suggest/">spiked</a> during this period. Maritime contraband smuggling, however, saw a decrease from 2019 perhaps owing to COVID-19 restrictions. The largest types of contraband smuggled were drugs first, then tobacco, domestic products, and fuel (<a href="https://www.ifc.org.sg/ifc2web/app_pages/User/common/SharingPublications.cshtml">more here</a>).</p>
<p>Meeting the challenges of maritime security in the shadow of a global pandemic requires an inclusive and comprehensive response. Our <a href="https://brandonprins.weebly.com/indo-pacific-crime.html">research</a>, funded by the <a href="https://www.onr.navy.mil/">Office of Naval Research</a> through the <a href="https://minerva.defense.gov/Minerva-News/News_Display/Article/2469970/dod-awards-208m-in-grants-for-projects-to-support-research-in-social-and-behavi/">Minerva Initiative</a>, builds a framework to understand how pirates and other criminal actors inhabit maritime spaces where weak institutions, and a lack of naval power and cooperation among states, persists. In order to meet these complex maritime challenges head on, governments must strengthen regional cooperation, enhance maritime law enforcement, improve local governance, and address underlying economic conditions. States must further decouple maritime security from other larger sources of inter-state contention. <a href="https://www.maritime-executive.com/index.php/editorials/capacity-building-must-be-a-focus-as-sea-piracy-expands">Local capacity building</a> ought to be at the center of any effort to combat maritime piracy and crime. In its <a href="https://www.recaap.org/resources/ck/files/reports/annual/ReCAAP%20ISC%20Annual%20Report%202020%20v1(1).pdf">annual report</a>, for example, ReCAAP commended Filipino authorities for their intensified patrols in Manila and Batangas, which have improved security.</p>
<p>The United States must also continue its commitment to maritime security by deepening its relationship with allies and partners alike, especially in the Indo-Pacific. Through the FY16 National Defense Authorization Act, Section 1263, the Indo-Pacific Maritime Security Initiative (MSI) provides Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh with maritime security assistance and training. In Indonesia, this has meant “human capital improvements for strategic planning, budgeting, sustainment, and maritime security” (<a href="https://www.state.gov/u-s-security-cooperation-with-indonesia/">U.S. Department of State</a>; also see <a href="https://id.usembassy.gov/our-relationship/policy-history/embassy-fact-sheets/fact-sheet-u-s-indonesia-maritime-cooperation/">here</a>). In August 2020, the United States Navy once again hosted the <a href="https://www.cpf.navy.mil/rimpac/2020/rimpac-2020-electronic-press-kit.pdf">Rim of the Pacific (RIMPAC)</a> multinational maritime exercise. Ten countries engaged in anti-submarine warfare, maritime intercept operations, live-fire training events, and other activities all designed to build cooperative relationships to better tackle maritime insecurity.</p>
<p>Finally, the international community needs to aggressively combat the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. A focus on long-term inequities to better prepare for future shocks may help alter an individual’s calculus regarding the benefits of illicit activity, especially if secure employment and an adequate social safety net were available. Perhaps the best place to start is to encourage countries to fully implement the <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/i4356en/I4356EN.pdf">Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries (SSF)</a> guidelines outlined by the FAO. Many workers in the global fishing industry lack adequate legal and other protections. Interventions to shore up aquaculture production must give workers the tools to demand the necessary safety equipment, working conditions, and access to social services while the pandemic continues.</p>
